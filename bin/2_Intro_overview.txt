Data Structure and Algorithms

Data Structure = a names loaction that can be used to store and organize data e.g Family Tree, Array
Algorithm: a collection of steps to solve a problem e.g Linear Search

Big O notation"How code slows as data grows."
    describes the performance of an Algorithm as the amount of data increases
    Machine independent (# of steps to completion)
    ingore smaller operations O(n + 1) -> O(n)

            example:    n = amount of data
            O(1)        (it's a variable like x)
            O(n)
            O(log n)
            O(n^2)


        O(n) Linear time                       O(1) constant time
        public int addUp(int n){                int addUp(int n){
            int sum = 0;                            int sum = n * (n + 1) / 2;
            for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {          return sum;
                sum += 1;                       }
            }
            return sum;
        }
